#CSS-HASH

This repository was created to implement the concepts of `css munching` `css module` `css coposition` and `componentization`.

##Installation

`npm install`

`npm run dev-server` will start the server on `localhost:8080` and shows how css classes are being used with components and composition.

`npm run prod-server` will start the server on `localhost:8080` and shows how css classes are being composed and used in components as well as minified to resemble hashes for eg. `_R2d2s`.

Open the chrome/firefox devTools and inspect the elements using `dev-server` and after using `prod-server` and you will clearly see the difference.

Please look at the `src` folder to understand how the components and classes are written.
